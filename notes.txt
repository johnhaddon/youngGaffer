issues
======

plugs/parameters

	- plug has :
		- connections
		- dependencies?
		- signals
		- connectionValid() method
		
	- wrap parameters in a ParameterPlug?

nodes

	- nodes have :
	
		parent (another node)
		children
		compute
		signals

object naming / identification

	- all objects must have a unique id
	- use for selection, grouping, shader application etc
	- need integers for image based selection?
		- yes. id should be integer.
	- is id a "user:gaffer:id" attribute or a primvar?
		- an attribute. then ids can easily be applied to groups and procedurals.
		- we need Renderer::getAttr to work then.
			- RxAttribute does work for user attributes though
	
time

	- we'd like feedback for non-photoreal shit
	- we'd like dependencies at different times for shadow map generation

proxies

	- should be able to use low res standins but still have shaders work,
		deformers work etc.	

procedurals

	- everything should be a procedural?
	
	- procedurals should be able to operate on procedurals
		- this is where the SceneRenderer comes in
	  
	- how to determine bounds quickly for deformers and transform caches?
	
undo

	- how/where do we implement this?
		- what needs to be undoable
			- create/delete of nodes
			- parent/unparent of nodes
			- add/remove of dynamic plugs
			- set/connect of plugs

basic timeline
==============

stage one :

signals
nodes/plugs
graph ui
tweaker ui
script editor ui
read node
renderer node
viewer node
write node

stage two :

lights
manipulators
deformers (vertcache)
scenes/transforms
shader assignment
shadow map generation
primvars/per object shader tweaks
expressions

stage three :

hardware shaders
light linking
trace sets
pointcloud generation (within graph)
